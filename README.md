# Cropper

This is a rails-specific gem. It uses paperclip to provide a general-purpose upload-and-crop mechanism 
in which a single upload object (with attached file) can be shared between any number of models, and
each model can have any number of upload relations. Each associate has its own cropping paramaters.
